I contributed the following sequences to the [OEIS](https://oeis.org):

+ [A360285](https://oeis.org/A360285): Triangle read by rows: $T(n,k)$ is the number of subsets of $$\{1,\ldots,n\}$$ of cardinality $k$ in which no two elements are coprime; $n\ge 0$, $0\le k\le \lfloor n/2 \rfloor + [n=1]$.

### Galton--Watson trees

For my M.Sc., I worked on the probabilistic analysis
of combinatorial objects under the supervision of [Luc Devroye](http://luc.devroye.org). In particular,
we focused our attention on Galton--Watson trees and various structural parameters thereof.
I graduated in August 2022 with a thesis entitled
[_Structural properties of conditional Galton-Watson trees_]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/msc-thesis.pdf).

### Summer 2020

I received an NSERC Undergraduate Summer Research Award for Summer 2020. I worked with Asa Kohn under the supervision of [Michael Lipnowski](https://sites.google.com/site/michaellipnowski/), designing and implementing sorting algorithms on manifolds with the goal of efficiently building grids on these spaces.

### COMP 400 Honours Project in Computer Science

During the Fall 2019 semester, I undertook a project in the [Computation and Logic](http://complogic.cs.mcgill.ca) lab under the supervision of [Brigitte Pientka](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~bpientka/about.html). I worked with [Jacob Errington](https://jerrington.me) to develop a typechecking algorithm for the Harpoon proof language as well as a translation procedure to convert Harpoon proof scripts into programs in the [Beluga](http://complogic.cs.mcgill.ca/beluga/) programming language. The summary of the work I helped with can be found in the [slides]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/comp-400-slides.pdf) to my end-of-term presentation, and my [full report]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/typechecking-proof-scripts.pdf) is available for download as well.
