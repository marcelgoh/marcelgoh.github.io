I am the recipient of an NSERC Undergraduate Summer Research Award for Summer 2020. I am working with [Prof. Michael Lipnowski](https://sites.google.com/site/michaellipnowski/) to design sorting algorithms on manifolds with the goal of efficiently building grids on these spaces.

### COMP 400 Honours Project in Computer Science

During the Fall 2019 semester, I undertook a project in the [Computation and Logic](http://complogic.cs.mcgill.ca) lab under the supervision of [Prof. Brigitte Pientka](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~bpientka/about.html). I developed a typechecking algorithm for the Harpoon proof language as well as a translation procedure to convert Harpoon proof scripts into programs in the [Beluga](http://complogic.cs.mcgill.ca/beluga/) programming language. The summary of my work can be found in the slides to my end-of-term presentation, and my full report is available for download as well.
