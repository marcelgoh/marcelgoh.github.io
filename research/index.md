I am currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Mathematics, working on the probabilistic analysis
of combinatorial objects under the supervision of [Luc Devroye](http://luc.devroye.org).
My research interests include:

+ probabilistic analysis of algorithms
+ analysis of random discrete structures
+ group theory
+ additive combinatorics


### Submitted Papers

Papers submitted for publication in refereed journals.

### Reports

Various project and research reports. Some reports were written for internal distribution only, and are therefore
not available for download.

### Sequences

I contributed the following sequences to the [OEIS](https://oeis.org):

+ [A335562](https://oeis.org/A335562): The number of unlabelled unary-binary trees with $n$ nodes such that every node with two children has children of different subtree sizes.
+ [A338550](https://oeis.org/A338550): The number of binary trees of height $n$ such that the number of nodes at depth $d$ equals $d+1$ for every $d\in \{0,\ldots,n\}$.
+ [A338993](https://oeis.org/A338993): Triangle read by rows: $T(n,k)$ is the number of $k$-permutations of $$\{1,\ldots,n\}$$ that form a non-trivial arithmetic progression, $1\leq k\leq n$.
+ [A339941](https://oeis.org/A339941): Triangle read by rows: $T(n,k)$ is the number of permutations of $$\{1,\ldots,n\}$$ whose longest embedded arithmetic progression has length $k$.
+ [A339942](https://oeis.org/A339942): Triangle read by rows: $T(n,k)$ is the number of permutations of the cyclic group $${\bf Z}/n{\bf Z}$$ whose longest embedded arithmetic progression has length $k$.
+ [A341822](https://oeis.org/A341822): The longest known length of a 2-increasing sequence of positive integer triples with entries $\leq n$.

### Summer 2020

I received an NSERC Undergraduate Summer Research Award for Summer 2020. I worked with Asa Kohn under the supervision of [Michael Lipnowski](https://sites.google.com/site/michaellipnowski/), designing and implementing sorting algorithms on manifolds with the goal of efficiently building grids on these spaces.

### COMP 400 Honours Project in Computer Science

During the Fall 2019 semester, I undertook a project in the [Computation and Logic](http://complogic.cs.mcgill.ca) lab under the supervision of [Brigitte Pientka](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~bpientka/about.html). I worked with [Jacob Errington](https://jerrington.me) to develop a typechecking algorithm for the Harpoon proof language as well as a translation procedure to convert Harpoon proof scripts into programs in the [Beluga](http://complogic.cs.mcgill.ca/beluga/) programming language. The summary of the work I helped with can be found in the [slides]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/comp-400-slides.pdf) to my end-of-term presentation, and my [full report]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/typechecking-proof-scripts.pdf) is available for download as well.
