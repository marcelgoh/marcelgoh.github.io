In Summer 2021, I will start the MSc program in Mathematics at McGill University, working on the probabilistic analysis
of combinatorial objects with [Prof. Luc Devroye](http://luc.devroye.org).

### Summer 2020

I received an NSERC Undergraduate Summer Research Award for Summer 2020. I worked with [Prof. Michael Lipnowski](https://sites.google.com/site/michaellipnowski/) to design sorting algorithms on manifolds with the goal of efficiently building grids on these spaces.

### COMP 400 Honours Project in Computer Science

During the Fall 2019 semester, I undertook a project in the [Computation and Logic](http://complogic.cs.mcgill.ca) lab under the supervision of [Prof. Brigitte Pientka](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~bpientka/about.html). I worked with [Jacob Errington](https://jerrington.me) to develop a typechecking algorithm for the Harpoon proof language as well as a translation procedure to convert Harpoon proof scripts into programs in the [Beluga](http://complogic.cs.mcgill.ca/beluga/) programming language. The summary of the work I helped with can be found in the [slides]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/comp-400-slides.pdf) to my end-of-term presentation, and my [full report]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/typechecking-proof-scripts.pdf) is available for download as well.

### Submitted Papers

__S1.__ (with Anna M. Brandenberger and Luc Devroye) [Root estimation in Galton-Watson trees](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.05681.pdf). _arXiv preprint 2007.05681_. Submitted July 2020.

### Reports

__R1.__ [Typechecking proof scripts: making interactive proof assistants robust]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/typechecking-proof-scripts.pdf). Honours project report, McGill University (Montréal, Québec, December 2019), 10 pp.

### Sequences

I contributed the following sequences to the [OEIS](https://oeis.org):

+ [A335562](https://oeis.org/A335562): The number of unlabelled unary-binary trees with $n$ nodes such that every node with two children has children of different subtree sizes.
+ [A338550](https://oeis.org/A338550): The number of binary trees of height $n$ such that the number of nodes at depth $d$ equals $d+1$ for every $d\in \{0,\ldots,n\}$.
