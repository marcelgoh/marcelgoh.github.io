## Projects

#### [OPythn](https://github.com/marcelgoh/opythn)
A compiler and bytecode interpreter for a sizeable subset of Python, written in OCaml (with the help of Ocamllex and Menhir for lexing and parsing). Created as an individual semester-long software project under the supervision of instructor Adam Dingle at Charles University in Prague. (Expected completion: June 2019)

#### [Natural-Language Parser](https://github.com/marcelgoh/nl-parser)
A program that generates syntax trees for English sentences, written in Haskell. A blog post detailing the approach as well as the limitations of the program can be found [here](https://marcelgoh.github.io/2018/08/12/naive-parser.html).

#### [Miscellaneous Programs](https://github.com/marcelgoh/misc-programs)
A collection of small programs and scripts I wrote while learning new languages. Many are solutions to coding puzzles and challenges. Some of the most fleshed-out are:
+ [A calculator, implemented as a stack-based virtual machine](https://github.com/marcelgoh/misc-programs/tree/master/ocaml/ocalc) (OCaml)
+ [A program that collects and analyses weather data](https://github.com/marcelgoh/misc-programs/tree/master/haskell/Borsuk-Ulam) (Haskell)
+ [An implementation of some abstract data structures](https://github.com/marcelgoh/misc-programs/tree/master/c/data_structures) (C)
+ [A tool for analysing/generating Cayley tables](https://github.com/marcelgoh/misc-programs/tree/master/haskell/Cayley)  (Haskell)

## Hackathons

#### [ConUHacks IV](https://github.com/conudihedral4/nim)
My team implemented [Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim), a mathematical game of strategy, using the [Processing](https://processing.org) programming language and platform. I wrote more about it [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/2019/02/03/bits-and-doughnuts.html). (January 2019)
#### [HackPrinceton Fall 2018](https://github.com/marcelgoh/hackprinceton-2018)
My team created CourseTalk, a discussion and collaboration platform for students. A blog post describing the process and functionality can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/2018/11/14/coursetalk.html). (November 2018)

## Study

#### [SICP Exercise Solutions](https://github.com/marcelgoh/sicp-exercises)
Solutions to exercises from [*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html) by Hal Abelson and Gerald Sussman.

#### [COMP 206 Winter 2018](https://github.com/marcelgoh/comp-206-winter-2018)
