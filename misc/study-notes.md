title: Study notes
---

Here are study notes I created for certain classes. Many of them were created in a frenzy during the two or three days preceding an exam, so there are bound to be errors and I do not necessarily include every detail. That said, they are still quite meaty and I hope they can be of some use. If you wish to compile from TeX, you'll need to download some of my macros and typeset using the Plain TeX engine.
