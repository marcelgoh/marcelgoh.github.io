Music I have composed over the years. Play at your own risk (and the risk of others within earshot).

+ [Ballade No. 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/misc/noise/ballade1.pdf), written in Grade 9 (c. 2011) for an assignment in band class.
+ [Dance No. 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/misc/noise/dance1.pdf), written in first year (2017), during a caffeine-addled fit of procrastination.

The "No. 1" in the titles suggests that there will be "No. 2" pieces in the future. Please do not get your hopes up; after a long and celebrated career I have largely retired from composing.
