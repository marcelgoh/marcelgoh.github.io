Some poetry, written by yours truly.

### O Caml: A Sonnet

What spirit did awaken in my heart  
When first mine eyes met thy recursive gaze?  
How should I ever bear to be apart  
From thy gentle lists and thy static arrays?  
O Caml, let me plunge towards thy base!  
And pray thee, lest my stack should overflow,  
When thou bind’st me in thy function call’s embrace,  
Ensure no computation doth follow.  
How different can thy fine arrow-types be  
From those of Eros? For my desire doth burn  
As thou evaluatest eagerly  
My wretched soul, a unit to return.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;No other earthly language can compare,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And e’er I long to match thy patterns fair.

### Schulich 5

<span style="font-family:Courier">Number number = new Number();</span>  
Your number cuts my hand  
That bleeds your name in an arabesque swirl  
Of point-five Muji red
