(This is an SVG I stole from Wikipedia and edited; if you are an SVG guru and
know how to highlight {France, Morocco, Russia} without
highlighting {French Guiana, Western Sahara, Crimea}, please email me. __Update:__ the reverend
[Jacob Reznikov](https://axiomofchoice.dev/) helped me fix this.)

Closer to home, I've been to every province and every territory except Nunavut.
