I love travelling, both internationally and in Canada.
I have been to thirty-six countries (thirty-nine if you count stopping through an airport)
over five continents. Closer to home, I've been to six provinces (I hope to fix this soon by
heading to the Maritimes) and two territories. This page will have details of upcoming
professional travel as well as photos from past trips.

### Upcoming

This summer, I will be a teaching assistant for a workshop on
[Random Structures and Combinatorial Statistics](https://bocconi2022.lakecomoschool.org/program/)
at the Lake Como School of Advanced Studies.
