I write short stories in my spare time. Here's a
[blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}/2023/04/06/one-year-short-stories.html)
I wrote about my first year of writing and submitting short fiction.
I am a cofounder and editor of [Ahoy](https://ahoyliterary.github.io), a literary magazine
that publishes short fiction and poetry. As of July 2024, we have just put out our first issue!
