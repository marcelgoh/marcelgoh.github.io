I write short stories in my spare time. Here's a
[blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}/2023/04/06/one-year-short-stories.html)
I wrote about my first year of writing and submitting short fiction.

### Published stories

Here are my stories that have appeared (or will appear very soon) in literary magazines.

### Unpublished stories

Here are stories I am working on and hope to get published one day.
Unlike academic journals, literary magazines do not usually accept drafts that have
appeared online. So for now you'll just have to get excited about the (working) story titles and (approximate)
word counts. Whenever a story gets picked up I'll move it up to the "published" list.

&#x2600; "Senang Diri" (2900 words)  
&#x2600; "Terminal Velocity" (3200 words)  
&#x2600; "Of You and Me" (7700 words)  
&#x2600; "Yellowhead" (6400 words)  
&#x2600; "C'est À Elle De Décider" (8000 words)  
&#x2600; "Things Can't All Be Bad" (2600 words)  
&#x2600; "The Vigil" (3200 words)  
&#x2600; "Syazwani" (2300 words)  

### Other

Lately I've been trying to read more.
Here is a [list]({{ site.baseurl }}/writing/booksiveread.html)
