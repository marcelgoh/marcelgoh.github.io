I write short stories in my spare time. I hope to get some of these published at some point,
but unlike academic journals, literary magazines do not usually accept drafts that have
appeared online. So for now you'll just have to get excited about the story titles and (approximate)
word counts. When a story gets published I'll add a link!

&#x2600; "Mountain Pass" (3500 words)  
&#x2600; "Senang Diri" (2900 words)  
&#x2600; "Terminal Velocity" (3200 words)  
&#x2600; "Of You and Me" (7700 words)  
&#x2600; "The Girl on the Yellowhead" (7500 words)  
&#x2600; "C'est À Elle De Décider" (8000 words)  
&#x2600; "Things Can't All Be Bad" (2641 words)  

I don't write poetry in any serious capacity. But here are [some poems]({{ site.baseurl }}/writing/poetry.html).

I've been trying to read more in recent months (haven't we all).
Here is a [list]({{ site.baseurl }}/writing/booksiveread.html)
of the books I've read in recent years.
