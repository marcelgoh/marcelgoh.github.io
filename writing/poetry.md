Some poetry, written by yours truly.

### O Caml: A Sonnet

What spirit did awaken in my heart  
When first mine eyes met thy recursive gaze?  
How should I ever bear to be apart  
From thy gentle lists and thy static arrays?  
O Caml, let me plunge towards thy base!  
And pray thee, lest my stack should overflow,  
When thou bind’st me in thy function call’s embrace,  
Ensure no computation doth follow.  
How different can thy fine arrow-types be  
From those of Eros? For my desire doth burn  
As thou evaluatest eagerly  
My wretched soul, a unit to return.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;No other earthly language can compare,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And e’er I long to match thy patterns fair.

### Schulich 5

<span style="font-family:Courier">Number number = new Number();</span>  
Your number cuts my hand  
That bleeds your name in an arabesque swirl  
Of point-five Muji red

### Farewell McGill Ghetto

Bounded by Pine and Sherbrooke, Park and Peel: for four years—five if you dawdle, three if you're smart or
French or both—this is your world. It has been since the first torrid night you dragged your bags up
University and it will be till the day they read your name in the graduation tent. They tell you to escape
the Ghetto, and soon enough you find the courage to venture out. You picnic on Mount Royal, where raccoons
wring their hands and make puppy eyes for your blueberries. You have Kem CoBa on the rainbow Fairmount
benches, skate at Lafontaine Park, buy bagels on Saint Viateur, and discover the spherical delights of Montréal:
the orange one in the west and the mysterious orbs so far north you might as well be in downtown Saint-Jérôme.
But these things are not yours like the hot-dog man at the Y is; like the Burnside couch is after you
drop your assignment into the tenth-floor box at three a.m.; like the Durocher skunk is, who leads you home
after a drunken night; like The Word is, where you channel student-loan cash into books you won't read and
where, as we speak, two old men are having a loud conversation that foreshadows a leftist uprising.
Yours too is the fieldhouse across Pine and if you close your eyes you're there again blinking sleep away in
a stream of clammy bodies it's a seventy-percent final you could fail you could walk out three hours from now
and have failed _Please raise your hand and keep it raised if you do not yet have an exam._ the river has
emptied to form this great lake of a thousand students and here you're sat a part of it you take your pencils
out give them a few more twists in the sharpener for good measure _Please raise your hand and keep it raised
if you do not yet have an exam._ your toes dance and your fingers quiver the thing ought to have started by
now oughtn't it but look: four rows down there she is your friend you wave in exchange for a smile a feeble
smile because the solemnity of the occasion permits no more _The exam is three hours in duration. It is nine
oh-two. The exam has now started._ You turn the page over and breathe.

### Winter Sunset

I mean those days on the prairie when winter needs neither wet nor wind nor storm to
sustain itself and so exists---shining, glimmering, blazing---in stagnant perpetuity,
when the cold seems to come from within your very soul, the frost of you spilling out and pooling with the
frost of the world. The winter that reigns on these days is one that smiles bright and harsh, that does not operate
under cloak of shadow or justify its blows with clouds of gloom. On such clear days when night arrives
it rises
from all directions as a purple-orange fog, salvation in the form of a palliative void, its darkness no longer
light's opposite but instead inheriting the violence of a cruel, icy sun, and when the earth
sinks into its frigid depths it does not fall into the clutches of the hostile, but remains under the vicious
tyranny of the same.
