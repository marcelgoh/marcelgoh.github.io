<h2>Anansi Boys</h2>
<i>Neil Gaiman, 2005.
Finished 20 August 2020, reviewed 9 October 2020.</i>
<p>
A really funny book. More lighthearted than the other Gaiman books I've read, with the exception of
<i>Good Omens</i>, but that was also written by Terry Pratchett. The plot is outrageous and has
a few unexpected twists and turns. The characters are all very likable. I see it as Gaiman's take
on a romantic comedy, with a generous helping of the spooky fantasy that made <i>American Gods</i> so great.
Highly recommended.
</p>

<h2>The Old Man and the Sea</h2>
<i>Ernest Hemingway, 1952.
Finished 17 August 2020, reviewed 9 October 2020.</i>
<p>
Captivating and inspiring. I read this book in the span of an evening and the next morning.
Hemingway's prose made this very easy: with its short, snappy sentences, it is almost
written like a children's book. Made me want to be a fisherman.
