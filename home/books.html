<h2>The Art of Computer Programming</h2>
<i>Donald Knuth, 1968, 1969, 1972, 2011.
Reviewed 30 October 2020.</i>
<p>
Having recently finished Volume 4A, I thought I'd review the whole set of <i>The Art of Computer Programming</i>
books together, even though I read the others over a year ago. I would also like to qualify this review
that by "finished," I mean to say thatSI read the books from cover to cover, doing only a handful of exercises
and not necessarily fully grasping a concept before moving on. This is, I believe, the best way to read Knuth. Some
people complain that the books are too dense, but I think that these people are trying to understand every single
little detail &mdash; which would take a lifetime! My opinion is that Knuth's writing style is very enjoyable and
that one can get a lot out of these books by just reading his overarching
explanations of concepts, stopping to smell the mathematical roses now and then and doing the exercises
that seem fun. This also makes it easier to use these books as a reference later on. If I ever come
across a concept in class or while doing research
that I know I've seen in TAOCP somewhere, I can usually locate it within a couple of minutes.
</p>

<h3>Volume 1: Fundamental Algorithms</h3>  (<i>Finished 10 June 2019.</i>)
<p>
The first TAOCP book is the most foundational, as the title suggests, and if you only have it in your budget to
buy one of these books, it's the one I'd recommend. The first hundred-or-so pages give a crash course on
the mathematical concepts and tools that Knuth employs most. The next hundred pages are a description of the
imaginary computer that Knuth uses in all his code examples, as well as some basic programming techniques. This
brings us to one of the biggest complaints about this series of textbooks: all of the code examples are written
in assembly! But I had a lot of fun learning how Knuth's strange imaginary computer worked and writing a
<a href="https://github.com/marcelgoh/misc-programs/tree/master/mix">bunch of programs</a>
in <tt>MIX</tt> assembly. The highlight of this section is a <tt>MIX</tt> simulator, written in <tt>MIX</tt> itself!
The fact that this simulator only requires about 300 lines of assembly really demonstrates
how bare-bones this computer is. But of course, the goal of these books isn't to teach the reader how to program
in assembly. The hope is that seeing the algorithms implemented at such a low-level will make programming
them in any higher-level language a breeze. And of course, every program is accompanied by a detailed description
of the algorithm in the highest-level programming language of all: plain old English! This is the format of
the second half of the book, which introduces linked lists, trees, and uses this concept to describe methods
for automatic garbage collection and dynamic storage allocation in a low-level computer.
</p>

<h3>Volume 2: Seminumerical Algorithms</h3>  (<i>Finished 1 August 2019.</i>)
<p>
This is the TAOCP book I see referenced/recommended the least, and admittedly it is the one
I have found least useful as a reference so far. But, for me, it was the most enjoyable read of them all.
The first two-hundred pages deal with methods for generating random numbers and checking if a sequence
is sufficiently random. At times, Knuth gets quite philosophical, and the main takeaway of this chapter
is that there isn't a totally well-defined concept of what a random sequence should be, at least as
far as computers are concerned. The second chapter of this volume deals with arithmetic, starting with
methods for representing floating-point numbers in memory and then diving into algorithms for adding,
multiplying, factoring, etc. A detailed analysis of every single algorithm is given, and Knuth doesn't just
restrict himself to real numbers; this chapter discusses generalises many of these operations to modular
arithmetic, polynomials, matrices, and power series as well. All in all, this volume concerns the concepts
that modern programmers take for granted on a day-to-day basis: the ability
for a computer to perform basic arithmetic operations quickly.
</p>

<h3>Volume 3: Sorting and Searching</h3>  (<i>Finished in late September 2019.</i>)
<p>
Because of the emphasis placed on sorting and searching algorithms in the undergraduate curriculum, this
volume is the most likely to show up on a computer science class' "recommended reading" list. True to its
title, Volume 3 is split almost evenly between sorting, in the first half, and searching in the second. All of
the bread-and-butter algorithms and data structures are covered, from quicksort to binary heaps to tries,
which makes this a very important volume, but also perhaps a bit boring, since any computer science major
will have seen many these concepts in undergraduate classes (though certainly in only a fraction of the detail
that Knuth devotes to them). There is a somewhat large section, complete with a wonderful foldout,
devoted to the ins-and-outs of merging large files stored on huge physical rolls of magnetic tape.
I found this section quite entertaining
because of the novelty of learning about how people used to store data, but most of it is quite useless
to the modern reader. I believe that Knuth intends to scrap it and replace it with something else in the next edition.
</p>

<h3>Volume 4A: Combinatorial Algorithms</h3>  (<i>Finished 18 October 2020.</i>)
<p>
Unlike the other three volumes, which contain two chapter each, Volume 4A doesn't even cover a whole chapter.
The reason for this is that when Knuth sketched out the skeleton of his books in the 1960s, the subject of
Chapter 7, combinatorial searching, was a rather small subject. But all of that changed in the 1970s and 1980s, when
the field of combinatorial algorithms exploded. The result is that Knuth took nearly forty years to write
just two sections of Chapter 7, but these two sections fill more pages than any of the other three books.
The first half of this volume deals with boolean functions, while the second half deals with the daunting task
of enumerating all elements of some combinatorial structure (e.g., tuples, partitions, trees). I found the math
in this volume to be harder than in the previous three, but I am happy that (in this volume as well
as the others) Knuth is always willing to pause the flow
of a section to dive into the mathematical theory. For example, in the section on set partitions, Knuth gives a
detailed description of the saddle-point method of deriving asymptotics. Where this volume possibly suffers is in its
breadth. The other three books all offer enough variation so that, even if you might not be interested in one
particular section, you might really enjoy a different one. But with 200+ pages on boolean functions and
200+ pages on enumeration techniques, Volume 4 definitely feels a lot more laser-focused in its subject matter.
</p>

<i>The Art of Computer Programming</i> deals with the timeless fundamentals of computer science theory,
and it is for that reason that they continue to be an important reference work even fifty years on. Because
of Knuth's wonderful exposition and beautiful typesetting, they are also a joy to read, and to skip them
would be to miss out on some of the best mathematical writing of the last century.

<h2>Surreal Numbers</h2>
<i>Donald Knuth, 1974.
Finished 9 October 2020, reviewed 30 October 2020.</i>
<p>
The premise of this book is somewhat outrageous: two young lovers, living alone on a deserted beach for some
unknown reason, discover stone carvings that reveal a deep mathematical theory. Because the storytelling
is in the form of a dialogue, Knuth can somewhat sketch out the different thought processes one goes through
when undertaking mathematical research. The definition of a surreal number is somewhat reminiscent of
other set-theoretic constructions of numbers: a surreal number is a pair of two sets, each of which
contains previously-created surreal numbers. The protagonists, Alice and Bill, are certainly a lot smarter than your
average deserted-island inhabitant, and they slowly uncover more and more properties of what, at first, seems
like a rather simple concept. The book only takes about an hour or two to read through, but the theory and its
ramifications will take a lot longer to sink in. Some interesting exercises are provided in the postscript.
</p>

<h2>Guns, Germs, and Steel</h2>
<i>Jared Diamond, 1997.
Finished 5 October 2020, reviewed 30 October 2020.</i>
<p>
Presents a sort of scientific approach to the history of human societies. The main thesis
of the book is that the differences in the trajectories of human societies
has much more to do with variation in geography
and environment, rather than being due to innate differences among human populations/races.
Of course, we are told in school that this is true, but without concrete evidence, people might be
tempted to secretly believe the old racist theories anyway. Well, this book attempts to remedy that
by providing clear, convincing arguments as to why some parts of the world "developed" at a faster rate than
others. The first
two-thirds presents the main topics, e.g., the presence/absence of domesticatable plants and animals, the
transition from hunter-gatherer societies to agrarian societies, and the formation of centralised governments.
Then, the arguments developed in the first two-thirds are applied to five historical examples: the indigenous
peoples of New Guinea and Australia, the homogenisation of China, the Austronesian expansion, the European
colonisation of the Americas, and the Bantu expansion in Africa.
The prose gets repetitive in some places, because Diamond will often reiterate his arguments in different contexts
to get his point across, but ultimately <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i> was quite an interesting read.
</p>

<h2>Anansi Boys</h2>
<i>Neil Gaiman, 2005.
Finished 20 August 2020, reviewed 9 October 2020.</i>
<p>
A really funny book. More lighthearted than the other Gaiman books I've read, with the exception of
<i>Good Omens</i>, but that was also written by Terry Pratchett. The plot is outrageous and has
a few unexpected twists and turns. The characters are all very likable. I see it as Gaiman's take
on a romantic comedy, with a generous helping of the spooky fantasy that made <i>American Gods</i> so great.
Highly recommended.
</p>

<h2>The Old Man and the Sea</h2>
<i>Ernest Hemingway, 1952.
Finished 17 August 2020, reviewed 9 October 2020.</i>
<p>
Captivating and inspiring. I read this book in the span of an evening and the next morning.
Hemingway's prose made this very easy: with its short, snappy sentences, it is almost
written like a children's book. Made me want to be a fisherman.
</p>

<h2>Catch-22</h2>
<i>Joseph Heller, 1961.
Finished 2 April 2021, reviewed 2 April 2021.</i>
<p>
I got this book back in first year, on my first visit to The Word. I read the first couple chapters,
then forgot about it and it sat on my shelf for three years. I just went back to read it and wow.
This is definitely one of the best novels I've read in awhile. I was expecting a comedy, and
on that front I was not disappointed&mdash;the absurd narration is laugh-out-loud hilarious in many places.
But this book is also extremely dark as well, and the skill with which Heller weaves the horrors of war
with irreverent and often blasphemous jokes really made <i>Catch-22</i> memorable. It's quite a famous
novel, and perhaps some parts would have been less shocking to me if I had been preempted that, at its heart,
<i>Catch-22</i> is a novel about World War Two, and not quite in the sense that,
say, <i>Blackadder</i> is a programme about World War One. I wouldn't say that there is a turning point
where the jokes go from lighthearted to disturbing. Instead, the whole experience feels like a slow descent
into madness, culminating in a chilling finale.
