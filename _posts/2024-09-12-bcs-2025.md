I'm excited to announce that my short story "The Vigil," which appeared in
_[Ricepaper Magazine](https://ricepapermagazine.ca/)_
last year, has been selected for inclusion in the anthology
_Best Canadian Stories 2025_, which showcases the best Canadian short fiction published
in 2023. If you're interested, the book should be out in stores in a few weeks, but in the meantime
you can preorder it from the
[publisher's website](https://www.biblioasis.com/shop/fiction/short-fiction/best-canadian-stories-2025/).
(But you should also consider buying it from your local independent bookshop!)
