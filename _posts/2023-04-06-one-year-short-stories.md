In early July of 2021, I was on a holiday with my parents in Canmore. This was the first stop in a
long journey during which I planned to split off from my parents in Revelstoke, meet my university friends in
Kelowna, and then drive across Canada back to Montr√©al, so I had brought a decent stack of books with me.
In that stack was a short story collection by Margaret Atwood
called _Dancing Girls_. The stories themselves were pretty
good (honestly I don't remember the details of most of them), but it was the first page that intrigued
me. It looks like this (TeX reproduction because I don't have access to a good digital camera right now):

This led me to do a quick Google about short story magazines, and the short story publication process.
Although I'd had some vague concept that there must
be magazines/journals for short stories, I didn't know that _anyone_ could submit a short story to
one of them and be considered for publication.
And I definitely didn't know that you could publish stories in magazines first (over
a period of six years, in the case of this Atwood collection) and
then later compile them into a "real" print book like the one I was reading.

I loved writing stories growing up. Ones that stand out in my memory are a story about an ogre
that I wrote in grade five and a story I wrote about a starving kid who is looking for medicine
for his dying grandfather and he experiences some kind of hallucinatory dream (yeah kind of weird,
I know, and the conclusion is a total _deus ex machina_). At various parts of my childhood I thought
that I wanted to be an author, but that always meant writing _novels_ to me. Which of course is something
you commit your life to, and most likely end up starving when the novel doesn't get published or
doesn't sell.

I guess in summary I thought that short stories were published because the authors were already famous
from writing novels, but the Googling session revealed to me that often it was the other way around.
Writing a short story didn't seem like a massive commitment,
so there and then I resolved to write one. I read the stories in _Dancing Girls_, re-read some
stories from Ernest Hemingway's _The Snows of Kilimanjaro_, which I had brought along too but
already read a few weeks prior, and scribbled down a couple pages in the middle of the cheap
spiral notebook I used for math research. I'd recently done a huge hike
with my dad (nearly 50km in one day, over Gibbon Pass, Whistling Pass, and Healy Pass), so the mountains
were on my mind and it ended up being about a man going into the woods and hiking a mountain pass.

I had a sketchy outline in my head of the story arc, but I only ended up writing two pages of it
in Canmore, and soon forgot about it as my summer travels continued. Fast forward to April 2022
and my friend Steve
was over for tea. He was getting into writing some stories for his [website](https://stephenfay.xyz/),
and encouraged me to
write a few stories of my own. I dug out my old research notebook from the summer of 2021 and copied
down the first pages of my story onto my computer and finally got it done, exactly a year ago today! It
was about 4000 words long at the time, and entitled "Mountain Pass" (very creative, I know).

### Getting feedback

Over the next two months I wrote four more stories. Every set of tips you find online will say
that you have to get feedback on your work, so during this time I was sending my work to any
of my friends who would read it, and (because friends and family aren't necessarily the most critical
of readers), also online. Unlike with, say, math papers, you can't just post a story online and
then expect to publish it in a journal later; publication outlets typically want the work never
to have appeared in any sort of public capacity before. But I found a website called
[Critique Circle](https://www.critiquecircle.com/) where you can post your story and get feedback from
other users. It's not considered public because you need a membership to view the stories,
and a story goes up for only a week at a time, after which time you can choose to remove the story
from view. The site works on a credit system, meaning you earn credits by critiquing others' work, and
then spend them to be able to put your own story up for a week.

Critique Circle was a great experience, and much of what I know about writing and editing was learned
during the couple months I spent getting feedback and, perhaps more importantly, giving feedback of my
own. But ultimately, the comments you give and get on the platform tend to be quite surface-level, and
after a while I felt I was getting pretty okay at the line edits on my own. I was looking for feedback
on deeper topics like theme and plot structure.

During this time I was introduced to a friend of a friend who also did quite a lot of creative writing.
He told me about an online part-time
[creative writing
program](https://mediaarts.humber.ca/programs/creative-writing-fiction-creative-non-fiction-poetry.html)
that he was due to start soon, and I strongly
considered applying as well. Ultimately, I decided not to, mostly for cost reasons, but I was willing
to drop some money on learning how to write, so I ended up getting a freelance editor to look at
my work. It wasn't necessarily cheap either, but still significantly less than the creative writing course,
and because I paid story (whose individual cost was based on word count) I wouldn't have to commit to
spending $3600 all at once, and indeed during the last year I only spent a fraction of that.
The feedback
I got was excellent, consisting of line edits (like you'd get on Critique Circle) as well as a separate
letter that analysed some of the themes and plot structures of my stories and suggested how they could
be modified for greater effect.

I think ultimately most authors have workshops or small circles of author friends
from which they can get quality feedback of this sort for free (in return for feedback of their own), but
if you're starting out and want something one step about the quality of critiques from an online
platform like Critique Cirle but are not quite ready to invest or commit to something like a creative
writing course, I highly recommend the freelance option.
I'm not going to disclose the identity of my editor here since I didn't run this post by them and I'm not
sure how actively they are looking for more editing work, but they are a successful literary fiction author
in their own right, with&mdash;I think&mdash;a novel forthcoming.
(If you are looking for an editor yourself, reach out to me by email and I might
perhaps be able to send you details privately.) Maybe I will still choose to do a more formal creative
writing course in the future, but in the meantime I already learned a ton from my freelance mentor.

### Submissions and rejections

So with a handful of finished short stories, I set to work submitting them to literary journals. I
mostly focused on Canadian ones, of which there aren't really too many, but luckily most of
them accept all different kinds of stories, so it seems typical of Canadian authors to keep submitting
to the same dozen or so big ones over and over.

There are ton of guides online about the short-story submission process, so I won't go into a load
of details on how it's done, but honestly it's super easy
(the hard part is writing the stories in the first place!).
I more wanted to talk about it from a personal perspective, and point out a few similarities and
differences with the other main thing I submit for publication, namely, math papers.

First off, as I already mentioned earlier, short story magazines usually want stories that have
_never_ been published before, including on websites like blogs. This is in contrast with math
papers, which are often posted to the arXiv months before they end up in a peer-reviewed journal.
This is also why you won't see my actual stories in the [writing]({{ site.baseurl }}/writing) section
of my blog, as much as I want to share them with the world!

Secondly, with math papers you can only submit to one place at a time. Submitting to two places at
once is a great way of getting yourself blacklisted, and because there aren't that many trusted journals
out there (even fewer that are both trustworthy _and_ open-access, which is something I value). With
short stories there are tons and tons of magazines out there and most of them allow (and encourage) you
to submit to multiple places at once, provided you notify them immediately if a different magazine picks
up the story they are currently considering. This is great, since you have lots of options, but also
greatly increases the rejection rate, since the magazines now have to deal with a huge pile of stories.
(Incidentally, one of my stories was accepted to a magazine that _doesn't_ allow simultaneous submissions.
I wonder if the stats are different for those outlets, since presumably they don't receive quite as many
submissions at a time and for that reason their acceptance rates may be higher.)

This gets me to the topic of rejections. I'm not going to say some trite thing about rejection and how
it's the first step to success or something, but if you want to publish stories you just have to get used
to being rejected. It's more or less the default response. I thought I'd share a few stats about my own
rejections, both on the math side and the fiction side, which should encourage you to collect
some rejections of your own!

I've written seven math papers and made twelve submissions to math journals in total. Here's
the breakdown of what happened:

__Acceptances:__ 5  
__Currently pending:__ 2  
__Rejected:__ 4

Two of the five acceptances were following revise-and-resubmit decisions, but I didn't count those
as rejections.
Of the nine resolved submissions that's an acceptance rate of 55.6% and a rejection rate of 44.4%.
From what I hear this is pretty typical,
and there is generally a sense in the math community that any paper with correct results will eventually
get published _somewhere_, it's just that better, more impactful, papers will get published on their first
try, and usually in higher-ranked journals.

With short stories the acceptance rate is much much lower, but the simultaneous submission policies mean that
generally you can make lots of submissions at once. Of the short stories I've written, I've submitted six
of them and made twenty-nine submissions total:

__Acceptances:__ 2  
__Currently pending:__ 8  
__Rejected:__ 19

Of the twenty-one submissions about which I've heard back, I had an acceptance/rejection
split of 9.5% to 90.5%, so out of of the pending ones I'm of course expecting a ton more rejections, but
you really learn to get used to it. Because of the different ratios, I definitely still get pretty bummed
when a math paper of mine gets rejected, but don't really feel much at all when one of my stories is
rejected. I just look for another open submission call and submit again!

### Closing thoughts

Writing and editing my short stories definitely became a big part of my year off from school. I've
been working part-time and travelling a bit, which has given me lots of time to write and edit. This September
I'm returning to school to do my Ph.D., so the reality is I'll probably end up writing fiction a lot less, but I
really hope short stories will remain a part of my life. The long-term goal would be to get a dozen
more stories published and then group some of them (and some unpublished ones) into a short-story collection that
I could query to traditional book publishers. But at this stage it's a long way away, and I'm just focusing
on enjoying the process of drafting and editing.

I guess to end off I should discuss my two accepted stories. One of them is "Mountain Pass",
the very first story I wrote (as an adult) and the one I described earlier. It is in issue 79 of
_The Prairie Journal of Canadian Literature_. I've already been sent a copy so I thought the issue was
already out, but it seems from their website that it's still forthcoming. Two issues come out every year
so my story should appear sometime this year.

The second accepted story I'm not sure if I can disclose yet, as I only just got the email yesterday that it
is to be published. It's one of my shorter ones, and I wrote the original
draft in one sitting on a flight from Vancouver to Tokyo. What's exciting about this one is that
it will appear in an online format that
is free for all to read. I'll announce it and post a link as soon as I can!
