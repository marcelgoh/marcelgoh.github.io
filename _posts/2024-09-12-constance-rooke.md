I wrote a story back in July that I realised, upon reading it back, was entirely non-fictional
(modulo the exact words used in dialogue). A lot of the things I write are semi-autobiographical
anyway, so I was intending to pass it off as just another (fictional) short story. Then a couple of
weeks later I saw _[The Malahat Review](https://web.uvic.ca/malahat/index.html)_'s
submission call for the Constance Rooke Creative Nonfiction Prize, and I thought I might as well enter,
as it isn't every day that I write a piece of CNF.

Last week,
[it was announced](https://web.uvic.ca/malahat/contests/creative_non-fiction_prize/2024_winner.html)
that my piece, entitled "Lanterns", won the contest!
I was notified by email a couple of weeks earlier, but I'm still in shock and,
above all, super honoured. I made [a post]({{ site.baseurl }}/2023/04/06/one-year-short-stories.html)
talking about how I got into writing, and you'll see from that post that _The Malahat Review_ is
one of the very first literary magazines I ever became aware of. I was told that this year, there
were 115 entrants to the contest, and my piece was picked by judge
[Gloria Blizzard](https://www.gloriablizzard.com/).

My piece will appear in issue 229 of _The Malahat Review_, on shelves in early January 2025.
