[Jonah Saks](https://jonahsaks.github.io/) and I have uploaded our paper "[Alternating-sum statistics
for certain sets of integers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12535)" to the arXiv. We show that if ${\cal F}$ is
a set family in our class, then a certain alternating-sum statistic is constant. This constant equals $-1$
in the case where ${\cal F}$ is the set of all finite primitive sets. Towards the end of the paper,
we generalise the notion of primitive sets to $s$-multiple sets and show that if $s\ge 2$, then the
alternating-sum statistic we study is not constant, but as $n$ increases it equals $(-1)^s {n-2\choose s-1}$.

### Arithmetic constraints on finite sets

As a starting point, consider the following definitions. A set $S$ of integers is said to be

1. _primitive_ if for any two distinct $i,j\in S$, $i$ does not divide $j$;
2. _pairwise coprime_ if any two distinct $i,j\in S$ have $\gcd(i,j) = 1$; and
3. _product-free_ if for any $i,j\in S$ not necessarily distinct, $ij\notin S$.

We consider only finite sets in this post, and as a first observation, we note that taking $S$ to be
any subset of the primes, we satisfy all three conditions. Let's talk about primitive sets first. We
will count the number of primitive subsets of $$[n] = \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$$ that have size exactly $k$, for
$0\le k\le n$. Letting $P_{n,k}$ be the number of such sets, here is a table for small $n$:

![primitive-table]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/alternating-sum-statistics/pnk.png){: .center-image}

For example, $$P_{6,3} = 3$$ because there are three primitive subsets of $$\{1,\ldots,6\}$$ that
have size exactly $3$, namely, $$\{2,3,5\}$$, $$\{3,4,5\}$$, and $$\{4,5,6\}$$. Taking the alternating
sum of this whole row corresponding to $n=6$, we have a value of $1-6+7-3 = -1$, and
if you stare at the table, you'll notice that the alternating sum of each row (except the first
one) equals $-1$. Now look at the table for $Q_{n,k}$, the number of pairwise coprime subsets of $[n]$
of cardinality $k$:

![primitive-table]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/alternating-sum-statistics/qnk.png){: .center-image}

This time, the alternating sums equal $0$. Lastly, letting $R_{n,k}$ be the number of
product-free subsets of $[n]$ of size $k$, we see that the alternating sums are $0$ in this case as well:

The sequences $P_{n,k}$, $Q_{n,k}$, and $R_{n,k}$ are in the OEIS as [A355145](https://oeis.org/A355145),
[A355146](https://oeis.org/A355146), and [A355147](https://oeis.org/A355147), respectively. Miscellaneous
facts about these quantities were collected in the following proposition of our paper (this post follows
the paper's numbering).

**Proposition 3.** *For $n\ge 2$ we have*

1. *$P_{n,1} = Q_{n,1} = n$ and $R_{n,1} = n-1$;*
2. *$P_{n,2} = \sum_{i=2} (i-d(i))$, where $d(i)$ counts the number of divisors of $i$;*
3. *$Q_{n,2} = \sum_{i=2}^n \varphi(i)$, where $\varphi$ is Euler's totient function;*
4. *$R_{n,2} = {n\choose 2} - n -\lceil \sqrt n\rceil + 2$; and*
5. *for any $p$ prime and $k\ge 3$, $F(p,k) = F(p-1,k) + F(p-1, k-1)$, where $F$ can be any of $P$, $Q$, or $R$.*

### Partition-intersecting families

To unify the three examples above, we now introduce the class of set families mentioned in the top of
the post. Let ${\cal F}$ be a family of finite sets of positive integers. Let $F_{n,k}$ be the
number of elements of cardinality $k$ in $${\cal F}_n = {\cal F}\cap 2^{[n]}$$. We would like to study
the alternating sum $\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k F_{n,k}$. We will say that an element $S$ of $${\cal F}_n$$ is _maximal_
if for all $x\in [n]\setminus S$, $$S\cup \{x\}\notin {\cal F}_n$$.

Now for the actual definition. We say that a set family $${\cal F}$$ is _$$m$$-partition-intersecting_ if
for all $n\ge 2$, the following three conditions are satisfied (condition 2 does not depend on $n$ but conditions
1 and 3 do):

1. $[n]\notin {\cal F}_n$.
2. ${\cal F}$ is _downward closed_; that is, for every $S\in {\cal F}$, every subset $T$ of $S$ is also in
${\cal F}$.
3. The set $$M_n\subseteq {\cal F}_n$$ of maximal elements can be partitioned into $m$ disjoint nonempty
classes $M_n = C_1 \sqcup \cdots\sqcup C_m$ such that for all $i$, the intersection $\bigcap_{S\in C_i} S$
is nonempty, and for all $i\ne j$ and any $S\in C_i$ and $T\in C_j$, $S\cap T = \emptyset$.

We are now able to state the main theorem.

__Theorem 1.__ _Let $${\cal F}$$ be $m$-partition-intersecting and let $n\ge 2$. For $0\le k < n$,
let $$F_{n,k}$$ be the number of $$S\in {\cal F}_n = {\cal F}\cap 2^{[n]}$$ with $|S|=k$. Then_

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^k F_{n,k} = 1-m.$$

The proof of this theorem uses some basic results from enumerative combinatorics, relating the MÃ¶bius
function of a poset to the homology of a certain simplicial complex.

From here, we just need to show that primitive sets, pairwise coprime sets, and product-free sets are all
families that fit in our class:

__Corollary 4.__ _For $n\ge 2$,

1. $\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k P_{n,k} = -1$;
2. $\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k Q_{n,k} = 0$; and
3. $\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k R_{n,k} = 0$.

### A generalisation of primitive sets

A primitive set is a set that does not contain more than one multiple of any integer. We make this
definition more general by forbidding sets with more than $s$ multiples of any given integer, and when $s=1$
we recover the definition of a primitive set. For $s\ge 2$, the family of $s$-multiple sets is not
$m$-partition-intersecting for any $m$, but we still have the following theorem.

**Theorem 5.** _Let $s\ge 2$ be an integer, let $n>s$, and let $$P_{s,n,k}$$ denote the number of
$s$-multiple subsets of $[n]$ with cardinality exactly $k$. We have_

$$\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k P_{s,n,k} = (-1)^s {n-2\choose s-1}.$$

The proof of this also goes through the homology groups of a certain simplicial complex, but this time
the calculations involved are more technical.
