\sectheader{Research Experience}

\leftright{\bf Probabilistic analysis of branching processes}{\bf May 2020 -- present}
\leftright{\sl Research group}{\sl McGill University}
\smallskip
Ongoing research on branching processes, headed by Luc Devroye. Studied estimation problems
on Galton-Watson trees. Attended informal weekly seminars over the summer, discussing
various topics related to branching
processes. (Gave a presentation at three of these: one on root estimation in Galton-Watson
trees, and two on generating functions and elementary analytic combinatorics.)

\medbreak
\leftright{\bf Sorting algorithms on manifolds}{\bf May -- August 2020}
\leftright{\sl Summer research project}{\sl McGill University}
\smallskip
Research project under the supervision of Michael Lipnowski.
Studied algorithms that investigate the topology of group actions on locally symmetric spaces.
Work involved writing of code in OCaml and PostScript that generates illustrations of certain quotient
spaces, in various models of hyperbolic geometry.
\medbreak

\leftright{\bf Interactive proofs}{\bf September -- December 2019}
\leftright{\sl Honours research project}{\sl McGill University}
\smallskip
Semester-long research project in the Computation and Logic Group, supervised
by Brigitte Pientka.
Proved a theorem in constructive logic concerning the formal verification
of the interactive proof assistant Harpoon and wrote OCaml code as part of
ongoing work on the functional programming language Beluga.
\medbreak

\leftright{\bf Bytecode compiler and interpreter}{\bf February -- June 2019}
\leftright{\sl Individual software project}{\sl Charles University}
\smallskip
Semester-long individual software project under the supervision of Adam Dingle.
Created OPythn, a bytecode compiler and virtual machine for a subset of Python.
OPythn includes support for lists, dictionaries, named and anonymous functions, objects, and classes.
It is implemented in OCaml using Ocamllex for lexing and Menhir for parsing.
