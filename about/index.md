![me](profile.jpeg){: .center-image}

I'm a second-year undergraduate student at McGill University currently pursuing a BSc in Math and Computer Science with a minor in Linguistics. I was born in Singapore but spent most of my childhood in Leduc, Alberta. I graduated from Beaumont Composite High School before serving in the Singapore Armed Forces from 2015 to 2017.  

My first language was Java which I learned in my first semester in university. In recent months I've been programming in C and Scheme more, though I'm constantly learning new languages. I'm interested in programming paradigms, cryptography, and natural-language processing.  

When I'm not writing programs or attending school, I enjoy hiking, travelling, photography, and playing video games.
