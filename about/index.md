![me](profile.jpeg){: .center-image}

I'm a second-year undergraduate student at McGill University pursuing a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science with a minor in Linguistics. Currently I'm on exchange at Charles University in Prague! I was born in Singapore but spent most of my childhood in Leduc, Alberta. I graduated from Beaumont Composite High School before serving in the Singapore Armed Forces from 2015 to 2017.  

I received a traditional Java-based programming education from which I may never fully recover. When I write programs for fun I like to write in C, OCaml/Haskell/ML, and Scheme. My interests include abstract algebra, programming language theory, and compilers.

As a certified First Responder, I volunteer with the [McGill Student Emergency Response Team](www.msert.ca).

My favourite polygon is the pentagon.

When I'm not writing programs or attending school, I enjoy hiking, travelling, photography, and playing video games.
