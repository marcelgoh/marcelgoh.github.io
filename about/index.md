![me](profile.jpeg){: .center-image}

I'm a second-year undergraduate student at McGill University currently pursuing a BSc in Computer Science with a minor in Linguistics. I was born in Singapore but spent most of my childhood in Leduc, Alberta. I graduated from Beaumont Composite High School before serving in the Singapore Armed Forces from 2015 to 2017.  

I'm fairly new to programming and my first language was Java which I learned in my first semester in university. Nowadays I'm more comfortable coding in C, though I'm constantly learning new languages. I've slowly been working through [*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html) by Abelson and Sussman which has got me very interested in functional programming.  

When I'm not writing programs or attending school, I enjoy hiking, travelling, photography, and playing video games.
