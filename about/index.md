![me]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/profile.jpeg){: .center-image}

I am a Ph.D. student in Mathematics at McGill University, supervised by
[Hamed Hatami](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~hatami/). My primary research interest is in additive combinatorics.
I got my M.Sc. and B.Sc. from McGill as well. My master's thesis,
supervised by [Luc Devroye](http://luc.devroye.org/), was on Galton--Watson trees.
My B.Sc. was in the Joint Honours Mathematics and Computer Science program,
with a minor in Linguistics. In 2019, I also did an exchange semester at Charles University in Prague.

I am one of the founding editors of [Ahoy Literary Magazine](https://ahoyliterary.github.io/). If you write
poetry or prose we would be honoured if you submitted it to us!

I was born in Singapore but spent most of my childhood in Leduc, Alberta. I graduated from Beaumont
Composite High School before serving in the Singapore Armed Forces from 2015 to 2017.

My favourite polygon is the pentagon.

From 2017 to 2021, I volunteered with the [McGill Student Emergency Response Team](http://msert.sus.mcgill.ca/).

When I'm not doing math or attending school, I enjoy bouldering, [writing]({{ site.baseurl }}/writing/index.html),
[travelling]({{ site.baseurl }}/travel/index.html),
and [photography]({{ site.baseurl }}/travel/photos.html).

My CV is available in both
[TeX](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelgoh/marcelgoh.github.io/master/about/vita.tex) (compile with either
XeTeX or Plain TeX)
and [PDF]({{ site.baseurl}}/about/vita.pdf) formats.
