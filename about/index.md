![me](profile.jpeg){: .center-image}

I am a first-year masters student at McGill University, pursuing an M.Sc. in Mathematics.
Before that I graduated with a B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science with a minor in Linguistics, also from
McGill. I was born in Singapore but spent most of my childhood in Leduc, Alberta. I graduated from Beaumont Composite High School before serving in the Singapore Armed Forces from 2015 to 2017.

My favourite polygon is the pentagon.

As a certified First Responder, I volunteer with the [McGill Student Emergency Response Team](http://www.msert.ca).

When I'm not writing programs or attending school, I enjoy bouldering, travelling, photography, and playing video games.

My CV is available in both
[TeX](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelgoh/marcelgoh.github.io/master/about/vita.tex) (compile with either
XeTeX or Plain TeX)
and [PDF]({{ site.baseurl}}/about/vita.pdf) formats.
