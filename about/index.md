![me]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/profile.jpeg){: .center-image}

I am a first-year M.Sc. student at
[McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca), studying Mathematics.
Before that, I graduated from McGill's B.Sc. Joint Honours Mathematics and Computer Science program,
with a minor in Linguistics. I also did an exchange semester at Charles University in Prague.

I was born in Singapore but spent most of my childhood in Leduc, Alberta. I graduated from Beaumont Composite High School before serving in the Singapore Armed Forces from 2015 to 2017.

My favourite polygon is the pentagon.

From 2017 to 2021, I volunteered with the [McGill Student Emergency Response Team](http://msert.sus.mcgill.ca/).

When I'm not doing math or attending school, I enjoy bouldering, travelling and photography.

My CV is available in both
[TeX](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelgoh/marcelgoh.github.io/master/about/vita.tex) (compile with either
XeTeX or Plain TeX)
and [PDF]({{ site.baseurl}}/about/vita.pdf) formats.

Also, check out my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=Fa8bQiEAAAAJ)
and my [articles on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/goh_m_2.html).
