![me](profile.jpeg){: .center-image}

I'm a second-year undergraduate student at McGill University currently pursuing a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science with a minor in Linguistics. Currently I'm on exchange at Charles University in Prague! I was born in Singapore but spent most of my childhood in Leduc, Alberta. I graduated from Beaumont Composite High School before serving in the Singapore Armed Forces from 2015 to 2017.  

I'm probably most familiar with Java because it's what we use most at school, but when I write programs for fun I tend to use Haskell, C, and Scheme (which I find wonderfully elegant and frequently frustrating). My interests include abstract algebra, programming language theory, and compilers. If you are a time-traveller, I have a [gift]({{site.baseurl}}/misc/theoremata.html) for you.

As a certified First Responder, I volunteer with the [McGill Student Emergency Response Team](www.msert.ca).

When I'm not writing programs or attending school, I enjoy hiking, travelling, photography, and playing video games.
