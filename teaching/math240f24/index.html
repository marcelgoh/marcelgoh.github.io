<b>Classes:</b> Tuesdays and Thursdays 16:05 to 17:25 in Leacock 26.<br>
<b>Office hours:</b> <s>Tuesdays 13:00 to 15:00 at a bench under the western slab of Burnside Hall.
(I will be wearing a large black hat for visibility purposes.) In case of inclement weather, I will
hold office hours in Burnside 1117 instead.</s> Summer is over. Starting 22 October, my office hours
will be held in Burnside 1117. Time remains the same (13:00 to 15:00 Tuesdays).<br>
<b>Notes:</b> A PDF of the course notes can be found <a href="./notes.pdf">here</a>. These will
be updated shortly after each class with the new material covered. They are intended to be much more
comprehensive than what actually appeared on the board: a combination of everything I <i>planned</i> to
say, <i>did</i> say, and <i>wished</i> I'd said.<br>
<b>Midterm exam:</b> Wednesday, 23 October 2024, from 18:10 to 20:10.<br>
<b>Final exam:</b> Wednesday, 18 December 2024, from 14:00 to 17:00.

<b>29 August</b><br>
Today we introduced ourselves to each other and made some new friends. Then we talked about sets,
set-builder notation, special sets of numbers, and set inclusion. We did our first proof, a proof
by double-inclusion. Next we learned about set operations and laws thereof.
</p>
<p>
<b>3 September</b><br>
We learned about De Morgan's laws, defined the Cartesian product and power set, and talked a bit about
using counterexamples to prove that statements are false.
</p>
<p>
<b>5 September</b><br>
We began the lecture by discussing Russell's paradox, then embarked on a new section&mdash;propositional logic.
We defined
the AND, OR, NOT, and XOR operations, then learned some properties thereof. We ended the class by pondering the truth
table of the conditional operator. This was quite tricky, so we'll pick up next week by revising it.
</p>
<p>
<b>10 September</b><br>
We kicked off by going over the conditional and biconditional operators again, then
we defined the terms tautology,
contradiction, contingency, satisfiable, and falsifiable. We then launched into a long example about using
propositional logic to encode a Sudoku game. Then we briefly touched upon the <i>boolean satisfiability
problem</i>, which is outside the scope of the course, but you can read more about its importance to
computer science by searching it up on Wikipedia, etc.
</p>
<p>
<b>12 September</b><br>
Today we started a new section on predicate logic, learning how to translate between English sentences
and formulas in this logic. We also learned how to negate statements. Then we moved on to yet another
new section on proofs. We learned what constitutes proofs of "for all" and "there exists" statements.
It is at this junction where we had our first fearsome encounter with the Adversary.
</p>
<p>
<b>17 September</b><br>
We continued to expand our toolkit this lecture, learning how to prove conditional statements, and introducing
three further techniques used in proofs: contraposition, contradiction, and case analysis.
We did lots of examples along the way.
</p>
<p>
<b>19 September</b><br>
Today we did one more (interesting) case analysis proof, then proved the principle of mathematical induction.
This proof used the <i>well-ordering principle</i>, a statement whose proof is outside the scope of the course,
but which you can learn more about on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-ordering_principle">Wikipedia</a>.
Mathematical induction is quite a difficult principle to digest;
this <a href="./tradeoffer.jpg">image</a> might clarify
the situation for you. We did two examples of proofs by induction (we'll see many more in the coming weeks),
then embarked on a new section: functions.
</p>
<p>
<b>24 September</b><br>
We learned about injective, surjective, and bijective functions, and also learned what it means for a function
to be invertible. To prove properties of these various types of functions required us to make a brief
digression and study the nesting patterns of pigeons.
</p>
<p>
<b>26 September</b><br>
This lecture was all about the cardinalities of infinite sets. We defined the terms countable and uncountable,
and proved that the set of integers and the
set of rationals are both countable.
To do so, we used the Schröder&ndash;Bernstein theorem (whose proof is a bit too long and difficult for this
course). We also showed that the half-open interval [0,1) is not countable,
using a diagonal argument due to Cantor.
</p>
<p>
<b>1 October</b><br>
We started a new section on relations, defining the terms reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
We then defined equivalence relations and their equivalence classes and considered many examples.
Last, we defined what a partition of a set is.
</p>
<p>
<b>3 October</b><br>
We proved that equivalence relations give rise to partitions&mdash;the last proof
in the foundations unit of the course. Then we moved on to the first section
of the number theory unit, namely, division. We defined what it means for an integer to divide another,
then proved various easy properties of the "divides" relation. Next, we asserted the existence of
a division algorithm (the proof of which was left to the notes), and proved the correctness of an
algorithm for finding greatest common divisors. We saw that with sufficient bookkeeping, the steps
of this algorithm can be followed backwards to express the greatest common divisor as an integer
linear combination of the two starting integers. This is called Bézout's theorem, and we will begin
next class by proving it.
</p>
<p>
<b>8 October</b><br>
Today I was sick and there was some amount of political unrest on campus,
so we congregrated on Zoom. We proved Bézout's
theorem and used it to prove a
proposition about frogs on lilypads jumping over lava. After that, we started a new section
on primes, and proved the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic: any integer at least 2 can be factored into
a product of primes, and this factorisation is unique up to the order of the primes.
</p>
<p>
<b>10 October</b><br>
First we used the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic to prove that an integer root of an integer is
either integer or irrational. Then we proved there are infinitely many primes. After that, we briefly
discussed the prime number theorem (its proof is far out of the scope of this class), before
moving on to a new section on modular arithmetic. We proved that congruence modulo <i>n</i> defines
an equivalence relation, then established that the equivalence classes are simply sets of integers
that have the same remainders when divided by <i>n</i>.
