<b>Instructor:</b> Marcel Goh<br>
<b>Classes:</b> Tuesdays and Thursdays 16:05 to 17:25 in Leacock 26.<br>
<b>Notes:</b> A PDF of the course notes can be found <a href="./notes.pdf">here</a>. These will
be updated shortly after each class with the new material covered. They are intended to be much more
comprehensive than what actually appeared on the board: a combination of everything I <i>planned</i> to
say, <i>did</i> say, and <i>wished</i> I'd said.
