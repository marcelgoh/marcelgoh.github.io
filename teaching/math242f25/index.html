Here are the questions we covered each tutorial, along with their solutions. I will not post versions
without the solutions. Just cover them, or make the window really small to show only one
question at a time. It is a good exercise in impulse control to try not to peek. That said, it is also
a good exercise to try each question for a good five to ten minutes, then uncover one sentence of the
solution if you're stuck and try to finish the proof from there, repeating as needed. Once you finally
get to the solution by this method, wait an hour or two (maybe go for a walk, get some food, work on your
COMP assignment, etc.)
so that you've "forgotten" the proof, then try again to reconstruct it, not from memory, but from
the understanding you gained by "cheating" the first time.

We discussed the contrapositive in general, then did a proof by contrapositive. After that, we saw
two proofs by induction and finished off with an interesting proof by cases.

I was sick so we had a cybertutorial today.
We did a proof involving images and preimages of a function, then dwelt on the definitions of supremum
and infimum for quite a long time. We finished by proving some properties of the absolute value
function.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="./tut3.pdf">25 September</a></b><br>
Today we did lots of problems involving the supremum and infimum. As dessert, for the last fifteen minutes
we talked about the Cauchy&ndash;Schwarz inequality.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="./tut4.pdf">2 October</a></b><br>
We were only able to do two problems today, one involving the Ruzsa triangle inequality, and the other
proving that the Archimedean property and the nested interval property together imply the least upper
bound property. I prepared notes about Cantor's diagonal argument, which we didn't get to, but as promised
they are in the PDF linked above.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="./tut5.pdf">9 October</a></b><br>
Today we did sequence problems from the problem sheet, which were boring but instructive. Then I finished
off with trying to prove that if a sequence converges to a limit, then its sequence of averages converges
to the same limit. The proof I'd prepared was wrong, so we figured out
a proper one together on the fly. It's probably
best for you to go over the complete proof in the PDF above though, since I was a bit messy with my
presentation during the actual tutorial.
